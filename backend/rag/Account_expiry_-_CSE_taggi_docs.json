You will soon be expiring from: https://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/Account_expiry/ 1/4 2025/8/1 17:00 Account expiry - CSE taggi Something : 1 Mar 2020 … Every CSE account is a member of at least one account class, and each of these class memberships has an expiry date. If only miscellaneous classes (such as quota classes, course membership, etc.) are expiring, then your account will remain active. If your main account class is expiring, then your account will be deactivated. A month before you expire from an account class, we will send you an email message to let you know what's going to change. This gives you a chance to get your access extended (if it shouldn't be expiring), or to prepare for any access changes that might result. The rest of the warning message will tell you what classes you will continue to belong to (if any). Read the email carefully to see what is actually happening.",
